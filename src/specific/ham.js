     The following is a naive implementation, but will always work.
     Never change it unless you have specific needs that absolutely require it.
     If changed, your data will diverge unless you guarantee every peer's algorithm has also been changed to be the same.
     As a result, it is highly discouraged to modify despite the fact that it is naive,
     because convergence (data integrity) is generally more important.
     Any difference in this algorithm must be given a new and different name.
